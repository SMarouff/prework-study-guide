# Sam's Pre-work Study Guide

## Description

The Pre-work Study Guide Webpage serves as a retainer of information for what I have and will learn throughout the bootcamp. Not only does it serve as a study guide, but also as a reminder of the foundation of my skills for when I look back on it in the future.

My eagerness and drive to start learning about coding and web development was my main motivation throughout completing this work.

I feel as if I've already learned a multitude of skills and information regarding HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I am very much looking forward to furthering my skills in coding and web development throughout the next few months.
